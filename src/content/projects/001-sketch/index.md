I drew the following sketches during a low period of time around 2017. I used an Ohto ProMecha 0.9 mm mechanical pencil with HB graphite which I purchased in San Francisco, CA and a white eraser on B5 Muji notebook paper. I had great difficulty drawing straight lines and curves. To remedy this and match the image on the paper with the one in my head, I extensively erased and redrew until I approached a satisfactory similarity. This was time consuming and very annoying. I have taken a break from this kind of drawing for the time being and this is the first time I am sharing it openly.
